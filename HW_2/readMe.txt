Homework consist of ipynb (notebook) files. The name of the first program is q1.ipynb. For the first part I wrote the program on my local computer as there is not much space in my google drive. To make it run you need to have a "fotos" folder in the same folder with that program. You need to have Python 3 to work it in your local computer. The name of the second program is q2.ipynb. I wrote it in the Google Colab and added the excel file to the my google drive into the path  "/content/drive/MyDrive/HW2/dataset.csv" . You need to have excel file in that path or you can change the file path to run the code correctly and you can run the program from Google Colab. There is no external python module in programs so just importing modules is enough. Also do not forget to run the cells with function definitions first. Without running you can see the results on the outputs of cells which I used for my report.
