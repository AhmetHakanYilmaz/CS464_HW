        "🛑 In the code cells before Q1 I uploaded dataset to my drive and unzip it to drive.\n",
        "\n",
        "🛑 For Load Data part after writing the CustomDataset class I wrote another code cell for getting the data from datasets and divided them according to the training,validation and test sets ratios. After that I shuffled the sets there and I did not need to make shuffle when creating DataLoader obejcts. I also initialized the transform in that cell which will be applied in getItem function of CustomDateset objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "🛑 For each sections training parts ( FCN,CNN and TL ) I wrote 2 code cells. In the first code cells, I tried to find best hyperparameters and in the second cell after I got the optimal hyperparameters I trained the model according to those parameters. I selected my criterion as **accuracy** rate. I could have saved models in just first code cell and use it for testing but I preferred training the model again with optimal parameters as in the homework it is not wanted from us to submit model.pth files. However, there is a drawback of that approach that I did not expect to encounter. After I trained with optimal hyperparameters I did not get exactly same rates( in same sets) with when I trained to select hyperparameters even though I used same hyperparameters. I think the reason behind that is randomity of the initial models' parameters when I initialize models. This causes models not to be exactly same even though they are trained with same procedure and same hyperparameters.\n",
        "\n",
        "🛑 For FCN and CNN I tried 6 different situations for 2 hyperparameters which are learning size and train_batch size. For learning rate I tried ( 5e-2,5e-3,5e-4) and for batch sizes ( 32,64,128) and set epoch number to 100. I did not change weight_decay and momentum so they were their default values which is 0. I set epoch size to 100 and printed accuracy and loss values in every 5 epochs in both training and validation sets. Training the FCN model and selecting hyperparameters approximately took 4 hours and training CNN model and selecting hyperparameters approximately took 8 hours. For transfer learning, altough I just replaced the final layer it was taking much more time according to FCN and CNN models and in first epochs accuracy rate was already very high so I decided to decrease epoch number to 30 and try in 4 different situations (32,64) for batch size and (5e-2,5e-3) for learning rates to decide optimal hyperparameters. \n",
        "\n",
        "🛑 In training parts, I preffered to calculate accuracy and loss values of training set while I make training in the epoches to make things faster. After every epoch finishes I calculated accuracy and loss values of the validation set. So it is the reason behind why training sets' accuracy starts lower and loss starts higher. Printed losses are loss per sample.\n",

        "FCN model has the Accuracy: 0.860, Precision: 0.849, Recall: 0.848, F1 Score: 0.848 and for CNN Model it has Accuracy: 0.846, Precision: 0.845, Recall: 0.848, F1 Score: 0.834 in the same test sets. As we can see numbers are very close to each other. However, I had expected CNN model to work better as it is very good for image classification. The reason behind that can be images was not complicated and did not have much positional characteristics that CNN model can understand better than FCN model. Anohter reason may be the test set we selected even if we randomly distributed sets at the end it is possible that test set can fit with one of the models with better. In training and validation parts, accuracy of the best CNN model was better than best FCN model in general. However in test set FCN model has slightly better accuracy rate.\n",
        "\n",
        "If we look at parameters; when we look at epoch number we can see that in both models it should be bigger than a number for accuracy and loss to converges their final values. We can see in plots when epoch is bigger than 40 accuracy and loss values of validation are very close to their values in the 100th epoch. Training accuracy gets smaller in every epoch as our models' aim in each batch to is decreasing loss of that batches. Although it is not always the case, training accuracy also increases in each epoch with updated parameters. Validation accuracy and losses do not behave same with test accuracy and losses. Validation accuracies do not go high as test accuracies and validation losses do not go down as training losses. When we look at the affect of learning rate by looking prints we can see if learning rate is bigger than it starts with a higher accuracy and lower loss and it reaches to the relatives of the final value much faster. When we compare FCN and CNN we can say that CNN is more complex model and even with the same hyperparameters reaching the optimal CNN model ( highest accuracy ) takes more epochs than FCN model as we can see in the prints. For batch size, in each models 128 batch_size was worst results with accuracy so I can say increasing the batch_size too much is not a good idea.\n",

With transfer learning our models' accuracy increases directly in first few epoches and loss decreases to small values in first few epoches. We can see that Resnet-18 is an appropriate pretrained model for our classification task as it increases accuracy. It can be said that Resnet-18 had already learned useful features that can be useful for our task. In addition, if the pretrained model was too complex for our classification then we could have seen overfitting and accuracy rate would not be high. "
