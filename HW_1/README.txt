The name of the file is q2main.py It is a python file and you need to have python3 in your computer to run it. No need to install external modules. The program imports built-in modules csv and math.
The training and validation files (bbcsports_train.csv and bbcsports_val.csv) should be in the same folder with q2main.py. For the question 2.2 you do not need to anything but just run. For the question 2.3 you need to comment lines 81,82,83 and 84 and take lines 86 and 87 out of comment. It terminates approximately 5 second in my computer it may take more in other computers. There are other comments is in the file for you to understand the variables. Without running you can see the results on the outputs of cells which I used for my report.
